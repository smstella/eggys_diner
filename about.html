        <h2>While its name may conjure visions of breakfasts...</h2>
        <p>The restaurant is, in fact named after the President of Magellan Development, David Carlins, childhood friend
            Robert Mallin, who was nicknamed "EGGY" (after his self-described egg-shaped head) back in the late 1960's.
            Characterized by his friends as loyal, fair and philanthropic, Robert "Eggy" Mallin personifies what Eggy's is
            all about - family, friends and community.</p>

        <h2>Interior design by Karen Harold of the acclaimed SSS international.</h2>
        <p>We wanted Eggy's to have somewhat of a "Mayberry" feel to it. Similar to diners of the 1960's. We want people to
            have a real sense of community and place when they set foot in the door. People working and living in the area
            can just drop in and enjoy dishes that remind them of home cooking, but with a focus on freshness, local ingredient
            sourcing and seasonality.</p>
